<h3 id="prof-ben-shiller-brandeis-university">Prof. Ben Shiller (Brandeis University)</h3>
<p>Relatively new phenomenon like internet commerce and massive data collection on consumer behavior (Big Data) may induce fundamental changes to the economy. Prof. Ben Shiller&rsquo;s research goal is to study these changes. Examples of his research include studying whether ad blocking reduces websites investments in content, whether proprietary data collection allows prolonged profitability even in the face of competition, and the impact of personalized pricing, i.e. setting unique prices to different individuals based on their web-browsing behavior. He has also studied how digitizing entertainment products impacts markets, via optimal pricing strategies and by shutting down resale. He incorporates related research directly into his teaching.</p>
